1500 - 1510   Welcome & overview of the goals of this meeting

1510 - 1540   What are the goals of DoH and DoT?  - could be a panel discussion with key DoT/H proponents / authors
              - Enumerate & discuss
              - Are there tradeoffs?

1540 - 1610   Discussion of network operator concerns (of all types) - could be a panel discussion w/draft authors
              - Centralisation
              - Fragility
              - Loss of filtering control
              - Discuss how to best get informed / meaningful user consent
              - Discuss any regulatory / legal issues that affect technology decisions â€“ such as GDPR compliance
              - Etc.
              
1610 - 1630   Other issues? - could include someone involved in the IETF human rights work
              - Is this a bigger issue than just DNS stuff?
              - If so, is there a need for a BoF/effort to consider the implications & tradeoffs between BCP 188 and https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-arkko-iab-internet-consolidation-00, or just between BCP 188 and how many networks operate today?

              
1630 - 1650   What are the best venues to continue discussion?
              - What WG should have what drafts?
              - Direction from ADs: where should DoH privacy stuff get done? Both the dprive and doh WGs are chartered 
              to work on DNS privacy. But Warren prefers it go to dnsop. Nobody seems to know for sure.
              - What other groups should be consulted / involved outside IETF? (e.g. ICANN if TLDs should support DoT)
              - Etc.
              

1650 - 1700   Next steps
